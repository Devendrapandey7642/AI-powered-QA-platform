/**
 * @module services/approvalService
 * @description Approval-decision business logic for AUTO-003b.
 *
 * Extracted from `routes/tests.js` so the route handlers stay thin
 * (HTTP shape only) and the provenance contract has a single home.
 *
 * Three provenance shapes flow through this module:
 *
 *   PROVENANCE_CLEAR  — null-out the four columns; written by every
 *                       "return to draft" path (single restore, bulk
 *                       restore, revoke). Previously duplicated in
 *                       three handlers, where the single-restore copy
 *                       went stale and shipped as a bug.
 *
 *   humanApproval()   — provenance for a manual approve click. Carries
 *                       `approvalSource: "human"`, `approvedBy` from
 *                       the actor, `approvedAt` from `Date.now()`,
 *                       and a null `approvalThreshold` (no threshold
 *                       was consulted).
 *
 *   computeStats()    — counts (human/auto/draft/rejected) plus the
 *                       7-day revert rate, computed off the activity
 *                       log because the `tests` row only carries
 *                       *current* state and revoked tests have their
 *                       provenance cleared.

/**
 * Compute approval-decision counts and the 7-day revert rate for a project.
 *
 * Counts are derived from the live `tests` table. The revert rate is derived
 * from the activity log because revoked tests have their provenance cleared
 * — only the audit trail can answer "was this auto-approval pulled back?".
 *
 * The revert rate is deduped by `testId` so a test that round-trips
 * auto-approve → revoke → re-approve → revoke within the 7-day window counts
 * as a single revert (and a single auto-approval). The metric answers "what
 * fraction of auto-approved *tests* did humans pull back?", not "how many
 * revoke events fired?".
 *
 * Defensive clamp: ratio capped at 1 so a backfill that produced more
 * revokes than auto-approvals in the window can't render "117% revert rate".
 *
 * @param {string} projectId
 * @returns {Object} `{ human, auto, draft, rejected, total, revertRate7d, autoApprovals7d, reverts7d }` — all `number`.
