/**
 * @module components/layout/GlobalRunBanner
 * @description Workspace-wide notice rendered above `<main>` whenever a
 * crawl/generate run is executing. Gives users on Dashboard / Reports / any
 * non-Test-Lab page a persistent affordance to jump back to the live
 * pipeline view, addressing the consistency-heuristic gap where a 3-minute
 * AI run was previously invisible outside Test Lab.
 *
 * Reads from the shared TanStack Query cache via `useProjectData({ fetchTests:
 * false, fetchRuns: true })` so we don't fire any new HTTP requests —
 * the runs list is already in cache for the sidebar / dashboard / TestLab
 * Queue tab. Hidden when:
 *   - no generation run is active, or
 *   - we're already on the Test Lab page (the inline pipeline view is
 *     a strictly better surface than this banner).
